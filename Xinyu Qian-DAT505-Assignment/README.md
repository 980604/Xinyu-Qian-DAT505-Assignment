#MUSIC Box
========
##introduction
My project name is music box, which is a visual music box. You can see two different kinds of animal, one pig and alpaca, rotate with music. Actually, they are playing on a swing. To represent  happiness, the pig will blink and the alpaca will dance.

##inspiration
The reason why I chose to do a music box is that it is too expensive to buy a music box. What is important is that the music box is easy to be broken.Therefore, I want to create a dreamy world to make everyone can have a music box.
I was inspired by Karim Maaloul, who created a collection of interesting works. He combined Coordinate System with geometries to create live creature and made some interactive effect. Therefore, I want to did some try.

##methods
First, I need to create 3 folders, which is 'build','css','js'and a html file to define the style of page and script source. Actually, I find a cloud library, so I can find files directly online. Then, I have to  build the scene. It is a complex process to create many geometries and define their names, position and material. To be clear, they are divided into a group. Next, I add animation and render. Finally, I import music.

##failure
In fact, I want to add audio visualizer in the music box. However, it is more difficult to analyze the audio and transparent it into visulization.
